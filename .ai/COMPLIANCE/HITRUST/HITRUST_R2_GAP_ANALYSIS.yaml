# Assessor Notes
# ===========================================
assessor_notes:
  strengths:
    - "Strong automated enforcement of security controls"
    - "Comprehensive evidence collection infrastructure"
    - "Well-documented AI governance framework"
    - "Continuous monitoring and metrics collection"

  areas_for_improvement:
    - "Formalize periodic review processes"
    - "Enhance root cause analysis documentation"
    - "Implement incident trending reports"

  overall_assessment: |
    The organization demonstrates strong control implementation with
    automated enforcement. Gaps are primarily in the measurement and
    continuous improvement areas, which are being addressed through
    the documented remediation roadmap. Overall readiness for r2
    certification is high with minor documentation enhancements needed.
